CIRCLES

This program generates randoms circles with varying size and positions, within a predefined range.
It finds overlapping circles, and try to separate all circles to eliminate the overlap.
This programm will display at first all the circles with their coordinates.
After that, it will identifies and displays pair of circles that overlap.
Finally, the program presents all the circles whith new coordinates if needed, so there are no overlap.


Compilation and execution:
To compile this program, you must be in the directory containing all the files.
you will write the following  command to successfully compile the program: 
g++ -o main main.cpp Circle.cpp CircleBehavior.cpp Point.cpp Utils.cpp
An executable file named "main" will appear, and you just have to write ./main to execute the program.

* it is important to note that, here, we are refering to a linux environment, particularly ubuntu.
* ensure that your C++ environment is properly configured before running the program
